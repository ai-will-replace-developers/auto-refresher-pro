##  AI REPLACES DEVELOPERS — THE PROOF

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE**

> This project is part of a **public challenge** proving that **AI can replace developers**.

> **Everything you see here — every line of code, every feature, every design decision — was created entirely by AI.**
> 
> I didn't write a single line of code. I just gave instructions. That's it.

###  The Challenge

I created this challenge to prove a simple truth: **Developers are becoming obsolete.**

With AI, anyone can now build:
- ✅ Advanced browser extensions
- ✅ Full-stack websites
- ✅ Mobile applications
- ✅ Complex automation tools
- ✅ APIs and backend services

**No coding knowledge required. Just ideas and instructions.**

###  This Repository

This is **Project #1** in my AI-built portfolio. Every project in my organization demonstrates that:

1. **AI writes production-ready code** — Not just snippets, but complete applications
2. **AI handles complex logic** — Multi-tab management, random algorithms, state persistence
3. **AI creates polished UI/UX** — Modern designs, responsive layouts, smooth animations
4. **AI debugs and fixes issues** — It finds and resolves its own bugs
5. **AI follows best practices** — Clean code, proper structure, documentation

###  The Organization

All projects live under my GitHub organization. Each one is:
-  **Built 100% by AI**
-  **Documented by AI**
-  **Designed by AI**
-  **Debugged by AI**

I am just the **instructor**. The AI is the **developer**.

###  My Message

To all developers worried about their jobs: **Adapt or get left behind.**

To everyone else: **You don't need to pay a developer anymore.** Just learn to communicate with AI.

The future is here. This repository is the proof.

## About This Project

A Chrome extension for multi-tab auto-refresh with random timing — randomly picks one tab and refreshes it at a time.

## Features

- **Multi-tab support** — Add multiple tabs to the refresh list
- **Random tab selection** — Each refresh cycle randomly picks one tab
- **One at a time** — Only refreshes one tab per cycle for natural behavior
- **Random interval refresh** — Set min/max delay, the extension picks a random time each cycle
- **Jitter** — Adds extra randomness to avoid predictable patterns
- **Cache bypass** — Option to force a fresh reload (no cache)
- **Quick presets** — Normal (300-700s), Relaxed (700-1000s), Slow (1000-1500s)
- **Live countdown** — See when the next refresh will happen
- **Next tab indicator** — Shows which tab will be refreshed next
- **Cycle counter** — Track how many refreshes have occurred
- **Auto cleanup** — Automatically removes tabs that are closed
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Toggle with Alt+R, refresh now with Alt+Shift+R
- **Clean UI** — Fresh green/white theme with modern design

## Installation

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `Auto Refresher` folder
5. Pin the extension to your toolbar

## Usage

1. Navigate to a page you want to auto-refresh
2. Click the AutoRefresher icon
3. Click **Add Current Tab** to add it to the list
4. Repeat for other tabs you want to include
5. Set your desired min/max delay (or use a preset)
6. Click **Start**
7. The badge shows the number of tabs being managed
8. Each cycle, one random tab from your list will be refreshed
9. Click **Stop** to pause

## Shortcuts

- **Alt+R** — Toggle auto-refresh on/off
- **Alt+Shift+R** — Refresh a random tab immediately

## Notes

- Minimum delay is 3 seconds (Chrome may enforce higher minimums for alarms)
- Protected pages (chrome://, file://, etc.) cannot be added
- Closed tabs are automatically removed from the list
- If all tabs are closed, auto-refresh stops automatically

## Version

1.0.0
